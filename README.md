# 🌐 CCNA Subnetting Practicals – FLSM & VLSM

Welcome to my hands-on **Subnetting Practice Repository** where I’ve explored and implemented both **Fixed Length Subnet Mask (FLSM)** and **Variable Length Subnet Mask (VLSM)** techniques. These subnetting strategies are essential for efficient IP address allocation in any enterprise or academic network design.

## 🎯 Objective

Gain practical knowledge of how IP addresses are divided and organized using **FLSM** and **VLSM** methods, crucial for understanding real-world network planning.
